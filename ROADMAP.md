# Roadmap <!-- omit in toc -->

This document contains the roadmap for GoToSocial to be considered eligible for its first [beta release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta), and a summary of progress made towards that goal.

All the dates contained in this document are best-guess only. It's useful to have a rough timeline, but things will undoubtedly change along the way.

## Beta Aims

The milestone for beta in GoToSocial's case is to have a feature set that roughly compares to existing popular ActivityPub server implementations (minus features which we don't see as particularly important or useful). The beta milestone also includes GoToSocial-specific features which we believe are vital for user safety, such as local-only posting, blocklist subscriptions, and so on.

Once feature parity is roughly in place, we will use beta time to start adding and polishing bonus features like slow federation, group moderation decisions, migration tooling, etc.

We currently foresee entering beta phase around the middle of 2023, though this is only an estimate and is subject to change.

## Timeline

What follows is a per-quarter timeline of features that will be implemented on the road to beta. The timeline is calculated on the following assumptions:

- We will continue to develop at a pace that is similar to what we've done over the previous year.
- Our combined bandwidth is roughly equivalent to one person working full time on the project.
- One distinct 'feature' takes one person 2-4 weeks to develop and test, depending on the size of the feature.
- There will be other bugs to fix in between implementing things, so we shouldn't pack in features too tightly.

Each quarter contains one 'big feature' which will probably take the longest amount of time that quarter.

**This timeline is a best-guess about when things will be implemented. The order of feature releases may change. It may go faster or slower depending on the amount of hurdles we run into, and the amount of help we receive from community contribitions of code. The timeline also does not include background tasks like admin, polishing existing features, refactoring code, and ensuring compatibility with other AP implementations.**

### Q2 2022

- **Big Feature** -- User settings page: allow users to edit their profile page and settings through a web page served by the GtS instance, for cases where client apps don't implement their own settings page.
- Blocklist subscription support: allow instance admins to subscribe their instance to plaintext domain blocklists (much of the work for this is already in place).
- Tag support: implement federating hashtags and viewing hashtags to allow users to discover posts that they might be interested in.

### Q3 2022

- **Big Feature** -- Video support: allow users to view + post videos (before we only implemented images and gifs).
- Custom emoji support: allow users to use custom emojis in posts. Fetch custom emojis from remote instances and display them properly.
- Pinned posts: allow users to 'feature' or 'pin' posts on their profile, and serve these featured posts via AP for other servers to see.
- Profile fields: allow users to set 'fields' on their profile: short key/value items that can display pronouns, links to websites, etc.

### Q4 2022

- **Big Feature** -- Reports: allow users to file reports for abusive behavior etc. Expose the API for admins to view + act on reports. Handle federation of reports.
- List support: allow users to create lists of other users which they can view as separate timelines.
- Polls support: allow users to create polls and vote in existing polls; federate the polls correctly via AP.

### Q1 2023

- **Big Feature** -- Sign-up flow. Allow users to submit a sign up request to an instance. Allow admins to moderate sign-up requests.
- Direct conversations: Allow users to see all direct-message conversations they're a part of.
- Muting conversations: Allow users to mute notifications for conversations they're no longer interested in.

### Q2 2023

- **Big Feature** -- Instance announcements. Allow admins to create/edit/delete announcements that are shown to all users on an instance.
- More to be confirmed.
