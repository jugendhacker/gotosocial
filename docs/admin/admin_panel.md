# Admin Control Panel

[gotosocial-admin](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial-admin) is a simple webclient that uses the [admin api routes](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/api/swagger/#operations-tag-admin) to manage your instance. It uses the same OAUTH mechanism as normal clients (with scope: admin), and as such can be hosted anywhere, separately from your instance, or run locally. A public installation is available at https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/admin/

## Using the panel
To use the Admin API your account has to be promoted as such:
```
./gotosocial --config-path ./config.yaml admin account promote --username YOUR_USERNAME
```
After this, you can enter your instance domain in the login field (auto-filled if you run GoToSocial on the same domain), and login like you would with
any other client.

You can change the instance's settings like the title and descriptions, and add/remove/change domain blocks including a bulk import/export.

## Installing the panel
Build requirements: some version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and yarn.
```
git clone https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial-admin.git && cd gotosocial-admin
yarn install
node index.js
```
This will compile a static bundle in `public/`, which can be copied to any webhost, or put into your GoToSocial installation in the `web/admin` directory.
