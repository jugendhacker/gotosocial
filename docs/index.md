# What is GoToSocial?

GoToSocial is an [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) social network server, written in Golang.

With GoToSocial, you can keep in touch with your friends, post, read, and share images and articles. All without being tracked or advertised to!

GoToSocial provides a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused entryway into the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), and is comparable to (but distinct from) existing projects such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), [Friendica](https://friendica.net), and [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/).

Here's a screenshot of the instance landing page!

If you've ever used something like Twitter or Tumblr (or even Myspace!) GoToSocial will probably feel familiar to you: You can follow people and have followers, you make posts which people can favourite and reply to and share, and you scroll through posts from people you follow using a timeline. You can write long posts or short posts, or just post images, it's up to you. You can also, of course, block people or otherwise limit interactions that you don't want by posting just to your friends.

**GoToSocial does NOT use algorithms or collect data about you to suggest content or 'improve your experience'**. The timeline is chronological: whatever you see at the top of your timeline is there because it's *just been posted*, not because it's been selected as interesting (or controversial) based on your personal profile.

GoToSocial is not designed for 'must-follow' influencers with tens of thousands of followers, and it's not designed to be addictive. Your timeline and your experience is shaped by who you follow and how you interact with people, not by metrics of engagement!

GoToSocial doesn't claim to be *better* than any other application, but it offers something that might better *for you* in particular.

## History and Status

This project sprang up in 2021 out of a dissatisfaction with the safety + privacy features of other Federated microblogging/social media applications, and a desire to implement something a little different.

It began as a solo project, and then picked up steam as more developers became interested and jumped on.

## Known Issues

Since GoToSocial is still in alpha, there are plenty of bugs. We use Github issues to track these. [Check them out here](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

### Client App Issues

GoToSocial works great with Tusky and Pinafore, but some other client applications still need work or have issues connecting to GoToSocial. We're tracking them [right here](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/projects/5). It's our goal to make any app that's compatible with the Mastodon API work seamlessly with GoToSocial.

### Federation Issues

Since every ActivityPub server implementation has a slightly different interpretation of the protocol, some servers don't quite federate properly with GoToSocial yet. We're tracking these issues [in this project](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/projects/4). Eventually we want to make sure that any implementation that can federate nicely with Mastodon should also be able to federate with GoToSocial.
